    "I am working with dicom images and RT structure and RT dose\n",
    "\n",
    "I have the following needs. Read through them and consider thoroughly and help me brainstorm developing options.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the entire workflow includes aliging the images to a template (rigid/affine alignment) and deformable registration of images of different timepoints. And the deformation (rigid/affine and deformable) will be applied to associated dose and contours as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are multiple warpings, which will degrade the data quality, I will have the option to compose the deformation and warp once in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose I will use this python library called: composable-mapping\n",
    "    github link: https://github.com/honkamj/composable-mapping\n",
    "    api reference link: https://honkamj.github.io/composable-mapping/composable_mapping.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Note this package might also satisfy my requirements below. Help me read the above docs thoroughly and identify which function is readily available and which I still need to develop by myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the key issue is the image/contour/dose live on different resolution and coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For images, I will resample to 1mm isotropic without much concern of loosing information\n",
    "For dose, the typical resolution is 0.5mm isotropic, I want to keep this resolution.\n",
    "For RT struct it is more complicated, typically it is drawn on axial slices and with potentially high in-plane resolution (floating numbers) and much coarser through plane resolution. The common practice is to rasterize to the dicom image grid as a binary mask, but this will lose the fine details.\n",
    "So my plan is to rasterized the contour onto a much finer grid, e.g., 0.5 or 0.25 isotropic resolution\n",
    "(however a potential issue is that I typically want to do this for very small structures, if I still keep the full image FOV it would be so many zeros and waste disk space, ideally I just want to store the local cropped mask that contains the entire structure, like with some affine matrix to identity how to align it in the full FOV)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So 3 important questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1). Does the rasterizing RT struct on fine grid make sense and how to do it in practice? What are the practical considerations?\n",
    "2). How to deform such dose and RTstruct defined in high relotion space and potentially cropped field of view?\n",
    "    I assume using the composable-mapping should be enough. Note I need both affine/rigid tranformation (which can be implemented via matrix operation that directly works for any resolution) and deformable resgistration (where the dvf would come from images and have the same 1mm isotropic resolution, and I need to upsample the dvf to deform the dose/rt_struct of higher resolution instead of downsampling the dose/rt_struct and deform with the 1mm dvf)\n",
    "\n",
    "3). How to display the dose/rt_struct with the images.\n",
    "    for dose it will have a higher resolution than the image, so larger matrix size\n",
    "    for rt_struct (consider masked vertion via rasterization with finer grid) it will have a higher resoluition and if I only keep the small FOV that contains the structure, it will have mismatch in FOV.\n",
    "    Is there a well-defined way to overlay the visaulization in matplotlib still? typcially the visualization requires same image size and resolution so resample is needed, can we not do that?\n",
